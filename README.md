# Post-mortem
1. Did you fail to implement any features you planned in your design document? Why?
Mechanics: My mechanics are trading, so I was going to upgrade the vehicle by trading the coins collected in the race with vehicle parts.
I could not implement that, instead I used coins as a way to trade half health after initial death.
I also could not make any throwable weapons.

2. Did you make any improvements to the systems of your game over the course of implementation? How did you decide to make these changes?
I improved the textures by using the correct tiling in the materials.

3. If you were to continue development on this game, do you have any planned improvements or new features?
Upgrade the vehicle mechanics, and use asset store to implement better models.
